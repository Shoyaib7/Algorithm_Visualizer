# Algorithm_Visualizer
This project is an interactive Algorithm Visualizer designed to help beginners understand how common sorting and searching algorithms work. It visually demonstrates the step-by-step execution of algorithms, making it easier to grasp concepts in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
# Key Features:

Step-by-step visualization of algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc.

Real-time updates showing how elements are compared and swapped.

Easy-to-understand interface for learning and experimentation.

Modular design for adding more algorithms in the future.

# Technologies Used:

Python

Pygame

Basic data structures and algorithm logic

# Purpose:
This project is part of my journey to learn DSA and algorithmic thinking. It provides a hands-on approach for beginners to visualize and internalize algorithm behavior instead of just reading theory.
